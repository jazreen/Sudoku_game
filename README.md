Sudoku Solver

Personal project started in Summer 2023
I took an initiative to self-learn Python that summer through HarvardX CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python and this project started as a means to consolidate my understanding of the concepts covered. 
The main aim of this project was to create a program that could solve any given sudoku matrix

Update as of summer 2023: 
- basic logic and structure implemented, program has bugs
(project discontinued during the school term sept-dec)

Update as of January 2024:
- All bugs fixed, program can now solve sudoku matrices! Main goal achieved, summary:
- Used backtracking algorithm and stack in Python; added option to let users upload puzzles through file I/O
- Designed and implemented solver with focus on clarity, efficiency and modularity to ensure maintainability
- Methodically conducted tests (including unit tests) to identify, resolve and document errors

Project revisited in Oct 2024: 
- Code structure changed to incorporate OOP features learnt in class (CPEN 333 and added some features to let users choose whether to solve a sample matrix or input their own problem
